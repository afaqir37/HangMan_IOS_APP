# HangMan_IOS_APP

In this project, I tried to write a game called HangMan. In this simple word-guessing game, each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in the removal of a bar from a battery. The battery represents the player's remaining guesses, and the objective is to guess the correct word before the battery is completely depleted.
